# esp32-cam

## üì∑ Introduction

This project contains example code for the ESP32-CAM module commonly found on AliExpress:

![ESP32-CAM Module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd8e7177-5787-4752-88bb-a274b01d3d1b)

The code is heavily based on the ESP32 Arduino library (Espressif Systems) examples, but has been reviewed and refactored to be simpler.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use **esp32 version 1.0.6** ‚Äî newer versions may be unstable and not work correctly with this module. Mentioned version of libary is also preserved in this repository.

**To run it, simply add your Wifi SSID and password in the .ino file, upload to code into your ESP32-CAM board, and then access the camera using IP address shown in your router setting or in the Serial monitor.**

## üîß Software Modifications

- To improve reliability, a simple workaround has been added: The ESP32 automatically restarts every **5 minutes**, which helps recover from potential Wi-Fi disconnections.
- LED functionality has been added and simplified - it's no longer PWM dimming, just a simple ON/OFF toggle.
- Default parameters  such as resolution and gain celling have been adjusted to higher higher values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Modifications

If you're using a motherboard like this:

![Motherboard Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78268632-2c51-4234-a0d6-db0731de24a8)

It is recommended to **cut the trace for GPIO0 after uploading the firmware**.  
Otherwise, the board may require pressing the **RST** button every time to boot.

## üìù Misc

- The code is fully working and tested.
- If you're unable to get an image from the camera, it's possible that the **OV2640 sensor is faulty** ‚Äî this is a common issue with cheap modules.
